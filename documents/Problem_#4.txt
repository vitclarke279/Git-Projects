Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer
in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest 
positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can 
contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2.
The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.

Working through:
	-order the list in ascending order.
	-looping over the index of the array. 
	-expect the next index to be N[i]+1
	-missing number can be after:
	positive number
	two  same positive numbers
	two same negative numbers
	negative number
	zero
	at the end of the array
