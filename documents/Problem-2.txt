-Problem #2
	Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index
	i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array 
	except the one at i.

	For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be 
	[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be 
	[2, 3, 6].

	Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

-Thought Process
	Function inputs a list N.
	First for loop which takes one index i at a time. Call index [i].
	Second for loop also takes one index at a time. Call index [k].
	Name vairable "product" equal to one (product = 1). Indent this into the fist loop.
	Make an empty set into which the new values will be inserted: (Product_list = set()).
	Insert this list before the loops.
	Need to make sure, it won't add the product of itself, by using "if".
	Tell to do a calculation if i isnt equal to k.
	calculation: product = product * N[k]
	once second loop loops round all numbers, add product into Product_list:
	Product_list.add(product)
