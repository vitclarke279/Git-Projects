Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

       0
      / \
     1   0
        / \
       1   0
      / \
     1   1

Solution
We can start off by first writing a function that checks whether a tree is unival or not. 
Then, perhaps we could use this to count up all the nodes in the tree.

To check whether a tree is a unival tree, we must check that every node in the tree has the same 
value. To start off, we could define an is_unival function that 
takes in a root to a tree. We would do this recursively with a helper function. 
Recall that a leaf qualifies as a unival tree.

Then our function that counts the number of subtrees could simplify that function
